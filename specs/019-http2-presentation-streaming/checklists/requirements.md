# Specification Quality Checklist: HTTP/2 Presentation Intent Streaming

**Purpose**: Validate Companion specification completeness before planning
**Created**: 2026-08-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details outside governed impact, contract, verification, and verbatim sections
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] Any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers are genuine ambiguities (≤3) deferred to clarify — not unresolved guesses
- [x] Each Functional Requirement is a single, testable MUST/SHOULD statement
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic except for the feature's required HTTP/2 protocol outcome
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] Implementation detail is limited to governed application-surface and exact-contract sections

## Notes

- The public protocol and generated RPC identifiers are feature requirements and are preserved under Verbatim Constraints.
- The exact ngrok HTTP/2 upstream option, both local h2c hops, and the generated Fetch request-stream transport are traceable from the source input into functional requirements and impacted surfaces.
- No unresolved clarification marker remains after the latest self-check pass.
